Hello... üòÉüëãüèª  
It's me Misael Randy Limpaty (ElMyosotisCode) your future Front End Developer Expert.

This project is my second learning project, for now it's only pure HTML without internal nor inline CSS.

## Roadmap

So here are my plan for this learning project
*May change in the future

**_Phase 1 : Barebone Structure (HTML)_**
- ‚òë **HTML** | Base structure & Semantics<br>
    Build the form framework with semantic tags (`form`, `fieldset`, `label`, etc.).

**_Phase 2 : Visual Styling (CSS)_**
- ‚¨ú **CSS** | Global Styling & Variables<br>
    Set up global styles and CSS variables for consistent theming.

- ‚¨ú **CSS** | Form Container Layout<br>
    Create a ‚Äúcard view‚Äù for the form so that it is centered on the page using `max-width`, `margin: auto`, and `box-shadow`.

- ‚¨ú **CSS** | Input & Label Alignment<br>
    Adjust the layout for each input group. Possibly use Flexbox to arrange labels and inputs neatly and responsively.

- ‚¨ú **CSS** | Custom Radio Button Styling<br>
    Hide the default radio button display and style the `label` to create a customizable, clickable star rating.

- ‚¨ú **CSS** | Input, Textarea & Button Styling<br>
    Styling `input` and `textarea`. Also, redesigning the ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù `button` to make it more appealing with `:hover` and `:active` state effect.

~~ <i>**Date:** 2025-07-23</i>

In this initiation session, I created the barebone of HTML structure, such as: ‚úå
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Base structure of my Feedback Form web page**
    - Including input boxes for name, email address, and a text area for feedback message.
    - I also added a rating system with radio buttons for user feedback.

## Key Learnings

### Learning Module Session 6 -> HTML Form Basic Structure

üí° Here are some key points I learned through this session:
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Structure of an HTML Form**
    - Understanding the basic structure of an HTML form, including the use of `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>` elements.

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Input Types and Attributes**
    - How to use different types of input fields such as `text`, `email`, and `radio buttons` to collect user data.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Relationship Between `for` _inside_ `<label>` tag and `id` _inside_ `<input>` tag**
    - The value of the `for` attribute in a `<label>` tag should match the `id` of the corresponding `<input>` element to ensure proper accessibility and better User Experience.

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ **The Significance of `name` Attribute**
    - The `name` attribute in form elements is crucial for identifying the data when the form is submitted, allowing the server to recognize the input correctly.
    - For `radio buttons`, using the same value of `name` attribute for each `radio buttons` in the same context, is meant to group them together and make sure only one option can be selected at a time.

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ **The Semantic Grouping of `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`**
    - The `<fieldset>` element is used to group related form controls, and the `<legend>` element provides a caption for the group, enhancing accessibility and clarity of the form.

- 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Utilizing Browser's Simple Input Validation**
    - Using the `required` attribute on form elements to ensure that users fill out necessary fields before submission.
    - Using the `type="email"` attribute on the email input field to ensure that the user enters a valid email format.
    - Using the `maxlength=200` attribute on the feedback textarea to limit the number of characters a user can input, ensuring that the feedback message is concise and manageable.
